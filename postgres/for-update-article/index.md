# PostgreSQL Queue Processing: How to Handle Concurrency Efficiently

In modern applications, efficient queue processing is crucial for maintaining performance and ensuring that tasks are handled in a timely manner. When dealing with high volumes of tasks, managing concurrency becomes a key challenge. PostgreSQL, with its robust feature set, provides powerful tools to handle these challenges effectively.

In this article, we will explore how to manage concurrency in PostgreSQL queue processing. We will provide practical examples using C# and Entity Framework, demonstrating how to implement efficient and reliable queue processing systems. Whether you are building a new application or optimizing an existing one, these techniques will help you ensure that your queue processing is both performant and concurrency-friendly.

Let's dive in and see how you can leverage PostgreSQL and .NET to handle queue processing with ease.

## Building the Playground: Deploying PostreSQL via Docker and Connecting to it using Entity Framework Core

Let's start by deploying PostgreSQL on our localhost. Here's a `compose.yml` file that does just that:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:13
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
```

After running `docker compose up -d` we should have our database deployed. Let's also create a new .NET project by running `dotnet new console`. Finally, we'll need a package for PostgreSQL provider for Entity Framework, a package to use `snake_case` naming convention and a console logger, for the observability. Here's the script to install all of them:

```sh
dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
dotnet add package EFCore.NamingConventions
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console
```

Now, let's make a very simple context with just a single table:

```csharp
public class Db(DbContextOptions<Db> options) : DbContext(options)
{
    public DbSet<QueueItem> Queue { get; set; }
}

public class QueueItem
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; } = null!;
}
```

Let's also do a very **not** production-ready helper method for initializing our database using the packages we've installed earlier:

```csharp
public static Db Create(bool useLogger = true)
{
    var options = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<Db>()
        .UseNpgsql("Host=localhost;Database=playground;Username=postgres;Password=postgres")
        .UseSnakeCaseNamingConvention()
        .UseLoggerFactory(LoggerFactory.Create(builder =>
        {
            builder.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Trace);
            builder.AddFilter("Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.ChangeTracking", LogLevel.Information);
            builder.AddFilter("Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query", LogLevel.Information);
            if (useLogger)
                builder.AddSimpleConsole(c => c.SingleLine = true);
        }))
        .Options;

    return new Db(options);
}
```

Let's also do another helper method that will allow us to instantly get a brand new database based on the schema we've described using our entity objects:

```csharp
public static async Task<Db> CreateEmpty(bool useLogger = true)
{
    var db = Create(useLogger);

    await db.Database.EnsureDeletedAsync();
    await db.Database.EnsureCreatedAsync();

    return db;
}
```

The next thing we'll need is a thousand queue items for us to play around with. Let's add a helper method for them:

```csharp
public async Task SaveThousandNewItems()
{
    var items = Enumerable.Range(1, 1000)
        .Select(i => new QueueItem() { Name = $"Task {i}" });

    Queue.AddRange(items);

    await SaveChangesAsync();
}
```

Before moving to the interesting part, let's test what we have here:

```csharp
using var db = await Db.CreateEmpty(useLogger: false);
await db.SaveThousandNewItems();

using var db2 = Db.Create(useLogger: true);
var count = await db2.Queue.CountAsync(); // should return 1000
```

I hope you'll also be able to successfully obtain a 1000, because now it's time to do some queue processing!

## Wrapping Up!

By following the techniques and examples provided in this article, you should now have a solid understanding of how to handle concurrency in PostgreSQL queue processing using C# and Entity Framework. Efficient queue processing is essential for maintaining the performance and reliability of your applications, especially when dealing with high volumes of tasks.
